# Purpose
This repo will contain all the tutorials I can find for BeeWare

Please be aware that at this time none of this code is mine except the buttonlist project. I am writing to see if I can refine it to my liking and also gain and understanding of the various techniques being demostrated

## buttonlist

Button list is an attempt to make dynamic forms to respond to my Gists project search results. http://github.com/pmfrank/gistapi
